PROGRAM MAMO - Models for Avian Management Optimization

Authors: Alban Guillaumet, Eben Paxton

Because Hawaii is the most remote archipelago of oceanic islands on earth, it has the highest percentage of land-based endemic birds anywhere in the world. Unfortunately, Hawaiian birds have suffered terrible losses since the arrival of people ~ 1000 years ago: entire groups have disappeared, while others have lost much of their initial diversity. For instance, only 17 species (one-third) of Hawaiian honeycreepers remain, 10 of which are threatened with imminent risk of extinction. 

We developed and present here a R-based program called MAMO that can evaluate the relative importance of different threats to Hawaii forest birds as well as the effectiveness of various management actions to mitigate the threats at Hakalau Forest national Wildlife Refuge and beyond. The program is designed to become an adaptive management tool for managers, allowing non-modelers to update information, design simulations, and obtain meaningful output. The name of our software 'MAMO' is an acronym of 'Models for Avian Management Optimization', based on the name of the extinct Hawaiian honeycreeper mamo (Drepanis sp.).
